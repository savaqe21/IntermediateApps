# WeSplit

### Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

My first iOS app starting my iOS adventure.

This project includes a check splitting app that you can use after eating at a restaurant - enter the cost of the food, choose how much you want to leave a tip and how many people to split the bill with, and you'll find out how much each person has to pay.

This project is not something complicated because its real purpose is to teach you the basics of SwiftUI in a useful way.
