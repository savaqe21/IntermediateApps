# RockPaperScissors

### Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

It is a game in SwiftUI made for brain training where the player must win or lose in rock, paper, scissors.

Each game turn, the app randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.
Each turn, the application alternately tells the user whether to win or lose.
The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.

If the player answers correctly, he scores a point, otherwise he loses a point. The game ends when you reach 10 points.

So, if the application selects "Rock" and "Win", the player must select "Paper", but if the application selects "Rock" and "Lose", the player must select "Scissors".
