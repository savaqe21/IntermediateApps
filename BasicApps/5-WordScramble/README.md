# WordScramble

### Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

This project is another game, although it's really just another way for me to introduce more Swift and SwiftUI knowledge! <br/>
The game will show us a random eight-letter word and ask us to make words from it. <br/>
For example, if the start word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.
