# GuessTheFlag

### Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

This project in SwiftUI is a guessing game that will help users to know some of the many flags of the world.
At the top of the screen is displayed the name of the country whose flag must be found from the three flags displayed below.
This is another easy project, but it teaches many basic SwiftUI techniques that will be used in further more complex projects.
